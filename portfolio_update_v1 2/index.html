        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who has had the desire to become a web developer for years, but continued to make excuses of why I would never be able to. I’m excited to continue my journey of software development and I look forward to learning and growing my skills!</p>
        <p>I am a very outgoing person and I have always been really into sports and fitness and I have always considered myself a very curious person I enjoy road trips with friends and family and I'm always down to meet new people and try new things!</p>
